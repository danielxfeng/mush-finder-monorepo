        <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p>
          By accessing and using this website (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by the
          following terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Disclaimer of Accuracy</h3>
        <p className='text-destructive'>
          <strong>Important Note:</strong> The identification results are for reference only. This
          tool may <strong>NOT</strong> be accurate enough for food safety decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‚ò†Ô∏è Consuming wild mushrooms based on this tool‚Äôs predictions can be extremely dangerous
          and potentially fatal. You are fully responsible for any decisions you make.
        </p>
        <p>
          NEVER consume a mushroom unless it has been confirmed as safe by a qualified expert, or
          unless you are 100% certain of its identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          üì¢ This tool is an <em>experimental machine learning project</em>. The training process
          may contain flaws or limitations that affect model performance. While the model achieved a
          certain validation accuracy under controlled conditions, this figure does not reflect real
          world performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In actual use, factors such as lighting, camera angle, image quality, and unfamiliar
          species can significantly reduce prediction accuracy. Results should therefore be treated
          with caution and must not be relied upon for food safety decisions.
        </p>
        <p className='text-destructive'>
          This software is provided <em>‚Äúas is‚Äù</em>, without warranty of any kind, express or
